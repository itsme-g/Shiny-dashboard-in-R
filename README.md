# Shiny-dashboard-in-R
This repository contains two R files: Shiny_plots.R and Shiny_plots_Lin_Reg.R to build Shiny dashborads.

# Shiny_plots.R
This program builds a Shiny dashboard allowing a scatterplot for any combination of variables to be displayed. It also generates histograms, boxplots and density plots for the selected variables.

# Shiny_plots_Lin_Reg.R
This program fits a linear regression model to the generated scatterplots. The chart also shows the fitted line, and a table with the slope and intercept within the Shiny dashboard.
